Also adding your own features to an existing development takes a lot of detail to prevent bugs occurring when you have successfully designed the features. </p>

In other words, when something is truly random then the result of the outcome can’t be predicted such as when you roll a dice at a game of monopoly or when you buy your lucky lottery numbers from the local convenience store. </p>

                                             <p class=" blog-pharagraph">So then, I created a box with class ‘wrapper’ which wraps around the elements of the balls inside the div tag. Inside this box, I added smaller boxes which represents the balls available to randomly choose from. There are 2, the left box is empty (uses the id ‘history’), and the right box is populated with the balls (uses the wrapper class).
                                             I have also added a generate button which uses some CSS and JavaScript to select the balls randomly and display these numbers in the empty left box.</p>

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph"> Finding jobs has never been easier than in the 21st century. In our today’s world the power of the internet has allowed us to be connected like never before. The amount of content out there waiting to be consumed by consumers is overwhelming to say the least. Social media websites that help us find jobs such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor, has created a globalised networking infrastructure which made finding jobs easier for the society. However, it is sometimes argued that although physically it is easier to search for jobs, mentally to prepare for them is another matter. Back in the days we only had CV’s and Interviews to determine the ideal candidate for the job, but now we need to create a well organised LinkedIn account that sort of repeats information from your CV, you also need the CV itself and lastly you still need to be interviewed.  </p>

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">LinkedIns’ and Glassdoors’ main mission was about helping people find jobs and companies to find the ideal candidate through using a digital platform that is within the reach of your fingertips. Now LinkedIn has over 660 million users in over 200 countries across the globe and Glassdoor has over 32 million unique monthly users on their site. These numbers are quite incredible. </p>

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">These platforms can provide jobs towards the society and helping businesses find their ideal candidates. Eventually other issues started to arise. The trust has decreased in the credibility of employees that made accounts on these websites due to the flexibility anyone gained from editing their individual accounts. Many other processes such as references helped to bring back the trust however these processes had to be stricter to provide reliable references. Building a bridge between employees and companies to reach each other has created an amazing environment for the society to communicate, however other issues has caused more measures to be placed by the companies which caused the employees to find jobs harder.</p>
                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">As a person who went through the process itself, I’ve now decided to work on an exciting project on creating a platform which has the potential to automate most processes such as references which can benefit both the employees and employers. </p>

                                         <h3>Employee Book </h3>
                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Employee Book is replacing the new way of interview process which enable individuals to drive their own development</p>


                                         <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Have you ever thought how much it costs for a company to just find someone for the correct position? Around 20-30% of the salary of the person who is being hired has to be paid mostly when using an agency. You can check out this blog about ‘The True Cost of Hiring an Employee in 2020’ to find out more. <a href="https://toggl.com/blog/cost-of-hiring-an-employee"rel="noopener noreferrer"

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Interviews are an embedded part of recruitment that has probably been used for a long time, but the process has never changed. In any case, as the use of information and innovation began to permeate selection, all parts of the interviews are subject to close evaluation and change. It is important for those responsible for monitoring this progress, as part of the new elective interview and appraisal approaches to consider other methods. Employee book aims to provide new approaches for companies to choose the ideal candidate for the job.</p>

                                         <p class=" blog-pharagraph">As these new platforms caused a larger traffic of job hunting has therefore also increased the difficulty in choosing the best. When companies pay for these agencies, the agencies will use algorithms techniques such as ATS ‘Application Tracking Systems’ to help filter and quickly find the correct employee. Due to the process being inflexible, it has caused many to exploit this system that are not qualified but still get through the ATS and others who are qualified but had insufficient knowledge of building an ideal CV. I wanted to create such a platform where both parties would benefit from using the platform equally.</p>

                                         <h3>What’s new about Employee Book</h3>

                                         <p class=" blog-pharagraph">I’ve decided to focus more deeply about gathering information from the company’s employees worked at. There are 2 main ways of approaching this:</p>
                                    <ul><li><p class=" blog-pharagraph">Develop an infrastructure where the company connects the employee to the jobs via using the app and afterwards a record of data will be gathered by the app from manager’s report and system information from recording when employee is late etc, during the period of the work the employee has served. This data is then analysed, and algorithms would create an employee score which can’t be changed by the employee itself or the company.</p></li>
                                    <li><p class=" blog-pharagraph">Provide a record sheet of the employee based on the data gathered from where the employee worked at. When the employee decides to change jobs, this record sheet then can be accessed by another company which can check important information of how productive the employee is.</p></li></ul>
                                        <br>

                                        <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
                                        <br>
                                         <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Although, this idea is still very new there are a couple of benefits and obstacles that arises:</p>
                                         <h5>Benefits</h5>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><p class=" blog-pharagraph">Automated process allows employees to not worry about remembering every date of employment and write about the experience.</p></li>

We have been assigned the task of helping out Dr Barikzai, who is involved in developing a learning enrichment environment in local schools to give opportunities for students to build up their IT skills and hopefully encourage some to engage in further study in the subject area. Equipment, such as Lego kits, Arduino boxes, a mini robot, as well as other kits, are used in these activities and we, as a group, have been given the task of developing a database system which has an inventory and keeps track of all the Lego parts stored within the school.</p>

                                        <p class="blog-pharagraph">Lego Education encourage children to get involved in engineering by visiting schools around the world to give them hands-in engineering experience using Lego. Children have opportunities to meet engineers and learn to create solutions using Lego that will increase their knowledge and desire to become engineers. The UK government has supported Lego Education and funded the ‘Year of Engineering’ campaign. Government Year of Engineering Envoy, Steven Metcalfe, explained the purpose of the roadshow that is a major element of the campaign:</p>

                                            <h3>The Problem we had to solve</h3>




                                        <p  class="blog-pharagraph">Whenever there was an event to teach young students, Dr Barikzai always had to check the Bobby 2.0 set that was used by the students, charge the batteries, prepare the other smaller Lego sets, and then go to various schools where the children would then play and code with the sets for the session. Upon coming back to the office, various pieces were sometimes missing. The most common piece that was always missing is the tracking ball, which has resulted in having to order this part on multiple occasions. There is no facility (apart from manually checking) to see if other pieces are missing. There are officially 32 boxes for the project, but in the office, there are additional boxes that are not specifically linked, which could lead to confusion arising. There are three types of boxes: EV3, WeDo and Mind storm. We had to solve this issue by developing an inventory control management system by building a database which allows staff to track each Lego piece of each kit.</p>
                                        <h3>Requirements from the client (Dr Barikzai)</h3>
                                        <br>
																				<ul>
		                                        <li>Create a database system for the Lego parts.</li>
		                                        <li>Make sure the system has a well-defined and easy-to-use user interface for the client to use effectively.</li>
		                                        <li>Deliver a presentation explaining how the system was developed and how it is operated and maintained.</li>
		                                        <li>Make sure the completeness of the projects follows all the client's requirements and no deviation has been made.</li>

                                        <p class="blog-pharagraph">In the field of computer science, programming languages are used by developers to build a bridge between the computers understanding what developers are trying to achieve. Now in the early days of programming, low level languages such as assembly existed which just allowed computers to perform certain functions using 0’s and 1’s. Eventually as technology developed rapidly, high level languages started to emerge such as Java, C, python and many more. These high-level languages allowed developers to be able to give instructions to computers much easier because high level languages were more understandable by humans.  </p>

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">This type of programming is very simple, however complex programs using this paradigm would cause the whole application to break because when you make a change to one function several other functions break (Spaghetti code). Meaning there are too much interdependency between all the functions created that it becomes inflexible and problematic to fix bugs and change code.  </p>
                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Eventually the Object-Oriented Programming (another programming paradigm), was created to solve this problem.

Such as when you use imported libraries for you own code, those libraries are also using abstraction. This process helps to make the interface of the abstracted objects simpler and also this reduces the impact of change as it doesn’t leak outside to the main method.</p>

                                        <br>
                                        <p class="blog-pharagraph">Skin care sets, make-up sets, fragrance sets, hair care sets, etc. are sourced from a number of suppliers who deliver goods to BCL’s warehouse in Uxbridge where the sets are assembled to order by a staff of 10. A standard range of around 50 sets is offered, but every so often a new set is produced for a special occasion. The marketing department is always on the lookout for new ideas and business opportunities. The company also has a policy of donating 2% of its annual total sales value to local charities.  </p>

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Each product making up a set is supplied by a single supplier and is given a unique product number and description by BCL. Products are always sold as part of a set, never on their own. A minimum stock level is recorded for each product and as soon as the stock falls below this, a purchase order is raised to replenish stock.   </p>

                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">The sets are sold via a team of salesmen who are paid a nominal salary with the opportunity to increase their earnings from commissions on sales. Commission is paid at 10% of the value of a set, but then goes up to 20% after a salesman’s annual sales target is reached. </p>
                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">The full list of sets offered is contained in the company’s catalogue. Prices range from the ‘Deluxe Re- creation’ priced at £650 to the more affordable ‘Regular Care’ set priced at £25.99. Each set has an imaginative description to entice customers to part with their money. The bulk of BCL customers are corporate clients who buy the gift sets as presents for their employees and clients. There is also good demand from young professionals who just fancy splashing out from time to time. The business is enjoying rapid growth and the current system of recording everything on Excel Spreadsheets is proving time consuming and leading to errors. </p>
                                          <p class=" blog-pharagraph">The owners are thinking of setting up an integrated sales order processing system but would like to do it in stages. The first stage will be a Customer Order Processing system as a ‘proof of concept’. This will enable the company to keep a record of customer details and sales for promotional purposes as well as to identify ‘high spenders.</p>
                                            <p class=" blog-pharagraph">If that proves successful than the supplier side too will be added later on. Payments are handled through PayPal due to security and fraud concerns and no changes are planned here</p>

                                    <p class=" blog-pharagraph" >Overall, in this project I have used conditions, user defined functions and loops. I have developed my algorithm in a structured manner which is easy to understand. However, this program lacked the Object-Oriented Principle and therefore some areas of the code is still not fully efficient to be used. Another project (Eurostar Train Java program) that I have developed uses such programming paradigm which you can check out <a href="#"  rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" >here.</a> </p>

                                                <p class=" blog-pharagraph">  I have been working in this industry for more than 10 years. I have always worked at very high end and demanding salons such as, Bliss spa, and Harrods. Many famous clients went to these salons and I had the opportunity to do their nails and have conversation with them such as  Margot Robbie, Rabel Wilson and many more. This job taught me a lot of skills such as communication skills by being very enganing with the clients and maintaining a good relationship with them; teamwork skills for working and treating everyone professionaly and working together; and also time managment skills where I learnt how to organise my time efficiently  which helped me to always finish my work on time and being prepared for the next client. It was a very good experience to work as a nail technician, but I always felt something else in me craved for a more challenging and creative job to do instead.</p>

                                            	<p class=" blog-pharagraph">My curiosity about how computers are used in the real world and how people using those technologies can benefit from them made me really interested in how I could create something to impact other people’s lives. However, when I was 18 years old, graduated in Hungary at high school, I never had any opportunities to study any computer science related fields because the computing career didn’t exist yet in Hungary. At the age of 21 I had my first child and because of these circumstances, I couldn’t develop my studies as I always prioritise my children future. Now at the age of 40, my youngest child (Brendon) is pursuing a career in the music industry and my oldest child (Bence) is pursuing a career in the field of Computer Science. </p>

                                            	<p class=" blog-pharagraph">When my oldest son went to college to study Computer science, he was always eager to learn new     things and improve his skill. My oldest son always loved to share with me what he learnt. I never forget when he showed me a diagram of how to calculate the binary numbers, at the time I was just proud of my son being so passionate about what he learns, but I didn’t know, I would be needing this knowledge in the near future. Bit by bit, as my son’s passionate energy grown and always sharing with me his knowledge of computer science, I’ve started to gain more interest about this field and also looked for  future careers for my son. One day after researching careers for my son, I have come across with a very interesting magazine, Forbes which was translated to Hungarian</p>

Interestingly after that moment, as time went by many small signs were shown to me such as when I had discovered during my work as a nail technician at ‘Harrods’ that the organisation uses software created by another company to enable customers to make a booking easily. When I had to use that software for the first time, I was really amazed at how someone can create such a useful, easy to use and well-designed program.</p>

At ‘CodePen’ I have undertaken many projects such as building websites, a calculator app and a euro million lottery random generator. From doing these projects I have learned the fascinated way that you can teach a computer to carry out something for you and the experience of solving problems with different perspectives. </p>

One day, hearing from my friend that my high school qualification can be actually used to study for a foundation course at a university. I still remember how excited I was about the fact that I have the opportunity to study what I started to love and being passionate for, and hopefully change my career towards something I will love to do.</p>

At the same time my son was studying 1st year Computer Science at University of Westminster. I’m very grateful for my son because he helped a lot teaching me during my foundation year. It’s quite Interesting because I used to educate my sons a lot when they were little and now the dice is rolled, and he is educating me, and he is very proud of what I have achieved so far. I know it sounds very interesting but as a parent we can still accept that our child can teach us many things as well and therefore I’m very proud of my child that he had selflessly given up his time to have the patience and determination of teaching and helping me. </p>

After 3 months I got a suprising email from google about my application that I've successfully got an opportuntiy for a telephone interview about the position which I've applied for. I was very excited about the call, it was unbeleivable. I still remember when I first decided to start this career for myself 2 years ago. Initially, It was just a hobbie of mine going to coding events and meetups to learn more about the field until little by little, I've gained more skills, and now after all these small steps, I've finally gained the opportunity to prove myself and showcase all the skills I've learnt after all this time. During my telephone interview the interviewer mainly asked a lot of <i><strong>behaviour </strong></i>questions mainly. </p>

                                             One of my friends who works in cyber security said she can help me to prepare for the interview. I’ve met her 2 times every week and we studied and made mock interviews a lot. My friend had the scariest idea to go into the Google office and also study there, she said this will give me more motivation to get prepared. I also learnt a lot at home.

Unfortunately, this did not go well at all, but I tried to talk that I was able to learn that that's why I applied an apprenticeships position. Probably this was not the right answer but I wanted to show them that I'm capable to learn anything if it interests me because I've always been very interested about how computers works.

                                             I considered this a good thing for everyone who has come this far to call us in  person and not just send an email for us. This way if you get rejected after all that hard work for weeks and weeks a person can kindly tell you, not just send a lifeless email to you.</p>

But unfortunately there was no good news. I tried to talk to give me another chance and I succeeded. So i got a chance in a video interview they said that they will be calling me from USA, Texas office. I was very happy but unfortunately nothing was said about what kind of interview it would be and how I should prepare for it. But I thought I had at least one last chance.
                                            Unfortunately this interview didn't work out either but this will not stop me achive my dreams.</p>

I applied to the apprenticeship because I like to learn new things and I believed is a great thing to study and learn the same time what you like. It is easier to learn by doing and applying the knowledge that you learnt. Anyway overall it was a great experience I learned a lot as well as learnt the command line and most importantly how the google does and interview.</p>

However, there is a bug in the messenger that allows for so-called watch attacks.But what it is all about? When a user logs into WhatsApp from a new device, they will need a unique code that will be sent to them in a text message. This code will allow you to recover your account settings and history from a backup on your new device.
                                                </p>
                                                <p class=" blog-pharagraph">If, on the other hand, hackers manage to get their victim’s phone number, they can download WhatsApp to a phone and enter that certain code (which they can get from the victim’s phone if they’re spying away from them) and already have the account and all their history. The specialist who revealed the possibility of an attack also tried all this with his colleague’s phone, and everything happened as described.</p>

This may seem obvious, but many people want to be able to view messages even faster because people find it difficult to give up their convenience. When people use two-step authentication (also known as two-factor authentication) without an authentication app, they tend to receive codes sent via SMS, but if they can be viewed on a closed screen, it’s a bit pointless for users who have left their phone unattended.</p>

                                                <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Therefore, secondly, never leave your phone or any device unattended. I have witnessed a lot, when people fall asleep on the train countless times while leaving their phones left on the table. </p>

Augmented reality differs from virtual reality in that we do not get into another space while completely excluding the real world, but remain in the same space, and non-real elements are projected into this real space. For example, when we are watching something through our mobile phone and our own camera is projecting images and information using an application. Let’s say we walk down the street while turning our camera towards different buildings and then the display shows the opening hours of that particular store or other information. Similar applications are currently being developed by various airlines. Apps help you find your way around the airport, find your seat, or turn your tablet or phone toward the window to find out where you are. </p>

                                        <h3># 3 Virtual Reality Technology (VR)</h3>


                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph" >The gaming industry has been exploiting the potential of virtual reality for some time, and this technology is also becoming more convenient, smarter and cheaper. It is almost difficult to list how many places VR could be used. For example, imagine not only watching a movie, but completely getting into the story!In addition to entertainment, there is a huge learning potential in these developments. They can be used to practice various surgical procedures, and soldiers can also be spiritually prepared for a possible deployment. VR can also help us get rid of our phobias, relieve our physical pain, or just look at how well we can say no to a glass of drink after recovering from our addiction problems.</p>
                                        <p class=" blog-pharagraph">Patrick Bordnick, dean of Tulane University’s School of Social Workers, examines in lifelike virtual spaces how well his clients are able to say no when they are offered a cigarette. In his <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460304002151" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first study,</a> he found that smoking in cyberspace is very similar to seduction than in real space. In her later research, she found that VRE-based skills development also enabled individuals to resist smoking in high-risk situations, such as when lounging with colleagues in front of the office, waiting for a bus, or drinking alcohol. Participants were more likely not to smoke even six months after treatment. Other studies have found that VRE therapies are also effective in coming down from cocaine and gambling.</p>

                                            <p class=" blog-pharagraph">If you had a digital assistant, you could connect it to other devices in your smart home: with voice commands, you could control the thermostat, air conditioner, lights, sockets, cameras based on the instructions you gave. Users these days are increasingly expecting everything to be wired together. Continuous design helps with data synchronization, which means that individual elements of the system can be upgraded and replaced individually, without having to redesign the whole thing. It also follows that when we get the latest version from an app or a widget, we can easily sync again with the other technologies we use again.

                                            <p class=" blog-pharagraph" >UX research is now developed, with the help of various programs, they can associate a score with products that characterizes them based on the quality of the user experience they provide. This includes behavioural data (how popular the products are) as well as attitude data (how easy they are to use; how reliable they work and how attractive their workmanship is). This is also useful because investors also receive feedback, so you can also instruct consumers on what programs, applications and gadgets are worth buying.</p>
                                            <h3>Do we really need all this?</h3>
                                            <p  class=" blog-pharagraph">Among the technologies listed above are those that seem to be a higher priority (such as innovations related to training, healing), and there are some that are more for our entertainment and comfort. With regard to the latter technologies, however, the question arises as to whether it is really so important to pull down the shutter with an application or to turn on the lights. Should everything be even faster when our lives are already completely up and running?</p>

																									is therefore true meaning the while loop still goes on as well as the for loop. </p>

																									<p class=" blog-pharagraph">Now here i = 1 and therefore in the if statement (arr[i] < arr[i-1]) is

																								<br>
																									<p class="blog-pharagraph">At i = 3 the next two values, 5 and 3, are not in order and therefore the if statement

Learning to program in various native and web languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript allowed me to dive into group projects and deliver a fully functional tourist website as well as using technical skills such as planning flowcharts and UML diagram to have the ability creating my first individual command-line application for a train ticket/seat reservation system using Java and also creating a student progression prediction program using python.</p>
